                <p class="flower-description">Flowers are a gift to this earth. As Gerard De Nerval once said, “Every
                    flower is a soul blossoming
                    in nature.” They
                    paint contrasting colors along the ground and bring joy to many. Their elegance and delicate touches
                    have us all in awe
                    and exhilaration. This is often why flowers are seen as loving gifts for the special people in our
                    lives, and the
                    reaction of the person receiving the flowers is priceless.</p>

                <p class="feature-description">Flowers like the Rose, the Jasmine, the Bela, and the Rajanigandha are
                    very sweet smelling. While
                    they are in bloom,
                    they scatter their fragrance around and act as a healing balm to all bruised hearts. Some common
                    flowers like the Lotus,
                    the marigold, the sunflowers, etc. are really beautiful to look at.</p>
